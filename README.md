### I'm R. Naga Arjun!
**Electronics Engineering Student @ VIT Chennai | VLSI & RISC-V Enthusiast**

Currently preparing for **GSoC 2026** with the FOSSi Foundation.

🔭 **I’m currently working on:**
* **[ZynqParrot Trace Encoder](https://github.com/RKNAGA18/zynq-parrot-trace-playground):** Building a cycle-accurate, RV64-compliant hardware trace encoder for RISC-V FPGA simulation.
  * *Key Features:* IEEE-ISTO 5001 Nexus Trace packetization, Variable Length Encoding (VLE) for trace bandwidth compression, FIFO backpressure handling, and Delta Timestamps.
* **SystemVerilog & C++:** Developing the RTL core and using **Verilator** for high-speed, cycle-based simulation environments.

🌱 **I’m currently learning & integrating:**
* RISC-V Processor Trace Specification (E-Trace) & Nexus 5001 Standard
* BlackParrot Architecture & Core Interfaces (`bp_common`, `bp_be_commit_pkt_s`)
* High-speed hardware simulation workflows (Migrating from Event-Driven to Cycle-Accurate testing)

🛠️ **Tech Stack & Tools:**
* **Languages:** SystemVerilog, C/C++, Python ,perl ,tcl
* **Verification & Simulation:** Verilator, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave
* **Domains:** Digital Logic Design, Computer Architecture, RTL to GDSII Flow
